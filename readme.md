Name (Should be required)
Email (Should be required and in a valid email format)
Pasjjjsword (Should be required and have a minimum length of 8 characters)
Confirm Password (Should match the password field)
Your task is to write JavaScript code to validate this form. Make sure to display appropriate error messages if any field fails validation, and prevent the form from being submitted if there are validation errors. Additionally, you can style the error messages to make them more noticeable to the user.

Sure! Here's an assignment for you that involves creating a more complex form with validation:

**Assignment: Dynamic Form with Advanced Validation**

You are tasked with creating a dynamic form for a conference registration system. The form should allow users to register for the conference by providing their personal information, selecting sessions they wish to attend, and optionally adding additional guests.

**Requirements:**

1. **Personal Information Section:**
   - Fields: Name, Email, Phone Number
   - Validation:
     - Name: Required, should contain only letters and spaces.
     - Email: Required, should be in a valid email format.
     - Phone Number: Optional, should be a valid phone number format (e.g., +1234567890).

2. **Session Selection Section:**
   - Display a list of available conference sessions.
   - Allow users to select multiple sessions they wish to attend.
   - At least one session must be selected.

3. **Additional Guest Section:**
   - Allow users to add additional guests (name and email) if they are registering on behalf of others.
   - Guests are optional, but if any are added, their information should be validated similarly to the personal information section.

4. **Dynamic Form Features:**
   - Allow users to dynamically add or remove additional guest fields as needed.
   - Implement real-time validation for all fields (as the user types).

5. **Submission:**
   - Upon submission, validate all fields and display appropriate error messages if any fields fail validation.
   - If the form is valid, simulate a successful registration (e.g., display a success message).

6. **Styling and User Experience:**
   - Ensure the form is visually appealing and easy to use.
   - Use CSS to style the form and provide visual feedback for validation errors.
   - Consider accessibility and usability principles.

**Additional Considerations:**

- You may use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to implement the form and its validation.
- Pay attention to code organization and readability.
- Test your form thoroughly with various input scenarios to ensure robustness.
- Prepare to present your form and demonstrate its functionality to the class.

**Submission:**
- Submit your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files along with any additional assets (images, etc.) you may have used.

Good luck with your assignment! If you have any questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask.
